# DevFlow Mission (Lite)

DevFlow is an AI-guided DevOps workflow assistant that helps developers implement professional development practices through Claude Code's extensibility framework.

Unlike traditional DevOps tools that require deep expertise, DevFlow provides intelligent guidance through custom slash commands, specialized sub-agents, and template-driven workflows - making enterprise-grade DevOps practices accessible to developers at any skill level.
