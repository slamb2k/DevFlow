## Pitch

DevFlow is an AI-guided DevOps workflow assistant that helps developers implement best-practice development workflows. It provides guided interfaces for project scaffolding, enhancement, and optimization using Claude Code's extensibility framework.

## Users

- **Individual Developers**: Looking to implement professional DevOps practices in their projects
- **Development Teams**: Seeking standardized workflows and best practices
- **Technical Leads**: Managing development processes and ensuring quality standards
- **DevOps Engineers**: Optimizing CI/CD pipelines and deployment processes

## The Problem

Developers struggle with implementing and maintaining consistent DevOps workflows across projects. Setting up proper CI/CD, security scanning, monitoring, and deployment processes requires deep expertise and significant time investment. Many projects lack standardized practices, leading to inconsistent quality and deployment issues.

## Differentiators

- **AI-Guided Workflows**: Intelligent assistance for implementing DevOps best practices
- **Claude Code Integration**: Native integration with Claude's code assistance capabilities
- **Extensible Architecture**: Custom slash commands and sub-agents for specialized tasks
- **Project Memory**: Persistent workflow state and learning from project history
- **Template-Driven**: Reusable configurations for common DevOps patterns

## Key Features

- **Custom Slash Commands**: `/devflow-init`, `/devflow-analyze`, `/devflow-roadmap`, `/devflow-optimize`
- **Sub-Agent Architecture**: Specialized agents for analysis, architecture, security, and optimization
- **Project Analysis**: Automated assessment of project structure and quality
- **CI/CD Templates**: Pre-configured pipelines for common frameworks and platforms
- **Security Integration**: Automated security scanning and compliance checking
- **Monitoring Setup**: Guided implementation of observability and alerting
- **Performance Optimization**: AI-driven recommendations for performance improvements
