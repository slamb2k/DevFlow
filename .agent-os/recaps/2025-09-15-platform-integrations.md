# [2025-09-15] Recap: Platform Integrations

This recaps what was built for the spec documented at .agent-os/specs/2025-09-15-platform-integrations/spec.md.

## Recap

The Platform Integrations spec focused on building comprehensive integrations with major DevOps tools including GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Slack. The first phase of implementation has been completed, establishing the core foundation for all platform integrations.

**Completed:**
- **Core Integration Framework** - Built the foundational architecture that will support all platform integrations
  - Implemented base Integration interface and abstract class for standardized plugin development
  - Created IntegrationManager with plugin loading and lifecycle management capabilities
  - Built secure credential storage system with encryption in .devflow/credentials/ directory
  - Implemented event bus system for cross-platform event routing and communication
  - Added webhook receiver infrastructure with Express endpoints for handling external events
  - Implemented rate limiting and retry logic with exponential backoff for robust API interactions
  - Comprehensive test coverage ensuring all integration framework components work correctly

**Remaining Work:**
- GitHub Integration implementation (OAuth, repository management, PR/issue creation, Actions workflow triggers)
- GitLab Integration implementation (OAuth, MR/issue management, CI/CD pipeline triggers)
- Jira Integration implementation (OAuth, issue management, JQL queries, automatic status transitions)
- Slack Integration implementation (OAuth, messaging, interactive features, notification rules)

The completed core framework provides the essential infrastructure needed for all platform integrations, ensuring consistent authentication, credential management, event handling, and error resilience across all supported platforms.

## Context

Implement platform integrations for GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Slack to enable DevFlow to work seamlessly within existing DevOps toolchains. The integration layer will support repository management, issue tracking, CI/CD automation, and team notifications through unified APIs and webhook handlers, allowing teams to maintain their current tools while adding intelligent automation capabilities.
