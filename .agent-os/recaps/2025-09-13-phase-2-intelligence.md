- **State Persistence**: Agent state management in `.devflow/agents/` directory with automatic save/load
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Agent initialization, cleanup, and event handling with proper error management
- **Command Integration**: Seamless integration with existing CommandRegistry for unified execution

**Key Files Implemented**:
- `/home/slamb2k/work/DevFlow/src/agents/AgentRegistry.js` - Central agent registry with 457 lines of comprehensive management code

- Code smell detection (long methods, god objects, parameter lists)
- Anti-pattern identification (swallowed errors, console.log statements)
- Circular dependency detection
- Security vulnerability scanning integration
- Performance profiling with bundle analysis

**Tests Implemented**:
- `/home/slamb2k/work/DevFlow/__tests__/unit/agents/AnalyzerAgent.test.js` - Comprehensive analysis testing
- `/home/slamb2k/work/DevFlow/__tests__/unit/agents/ArchitectAgent.test.js` - Architecture analysis testing
