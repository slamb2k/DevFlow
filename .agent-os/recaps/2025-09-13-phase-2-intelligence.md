## Context from Spec

The Advanced Analysis Engine implements AI-driven sub-agents and intelligent workflow recommendations as specified in the Phase 2 Intelligence brief. The system analyzes projects for security, performance, and quality issues while learning from patterns to suggest workflow improvements. The four specialized agents (Analyzer, Architect, Security, Optimizer) work through customizable output styles (Guide, Expert, Coach, Reporter) to deliver context-aware guidance.

The implementation successfully transforms DevFlow into an adaptive assistant providing specialized expertise through multiple communication styles, with comprehensive analysis capabilities that form the foundation for the smart recommendations system in Task 5.
