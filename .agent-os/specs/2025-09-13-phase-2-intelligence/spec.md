# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Phase 2 - Intelligence Features
> Created: 2025-09-13

## Overview

Implement AI-driven sub-agents and intelligent workflow recommendations to provide specialized expertise and context-aware guidance. This phase transforms DevFlow from a command-based tool into an intelligent assistant that adapts to project-specific needs and provides expert-level recommendations.

## User Stories

### Intelligent Project Analysis

As a developer, I want DevFlow to deeply analyze my project and provide expert recommendations, so that I can identify issues and optimize my workflow without manual inspection.

The developer runs `/devflow-analyze --deep` and receives a comprehensive report with security vulnerabilities, performance bottlenecks, code quality metrics, and actionable recommendations. The analysis adapts based on the project type and technology stack, providing relevant insights for React apps, Node.js services, or Python projects.

### Adaptive Communication Styles

As a team lead, I want to choose how DevFlow communicates with me based on my current needs, so that I can get information in the most useful format for my situation.

The team lead can switch between Guide mode for detailed tutorials when learning new features, Expert mode for quick technical answers during development, Coach mode when mentoring junior developers, and Reporter mode for generating comprehensive analysis documents for stakeholders.

### Smart Workflow Recommendations

As a solo developer, I want DevFlow to learn from my project patterns and suggest workflow improvements, so that I can continuously optimize my development process.

DevFlow observes the project structure, commit patterns, and development practices, then proactively suggests improvements like "Your test coverage has dropped below 70%, consider adding tests for the new authentication module" or "Based on your deployment frequency, implementing a staging environment would reduce production issues."

## Spec Scope

1. **Sub-Agent Architecture** - Implement specialized agents (Analyzer, Architect, Security, Optimizer) with defined expertise domains and communication protocols
2. **Custom Output Styles** - Create persona-driven output formatters (Guide, Expert, Coach, Reporter) with style registry and selection system
3. **Advanced Analysis Engine** - Integrate security scanning, performance profiling, code quality metrics, and dependency risk assessment
4. **Smart Recommendations** - Build context-aware recommendation engine that learns from project patterns and suggests improvements
5. **Template Customization** - Enable user-defined workflow templates and custom configurations for project-specific needs

## Out of Scope

- Machine learning model training (will use pre-built analysis tools)
- Real-time collaborative features (multi-user simultaneous editing)
- Cloud-based analysis services (all processing remains local)
- Custom language model fine-tuning
- Visual GUI components (remains CLI-focused)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Four functional sub-agents accessible through enhanced DevFlow commands with specialized analysis capabilities
2. Style selection system allowing users to switch communication modes with immediate effect on all command outputs
3. Comprehensive project analysis reports including security vulnerabilities, performance metrics, and actionable recommendations with measurable improvements
