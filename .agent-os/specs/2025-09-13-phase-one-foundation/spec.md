# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: DevFlow Phase 1 Foundation
> Created: 2025-09-13
> Status: Planning

## Overview

DevFlow Phase 1 Foundation establishes the core architecture and essential functionality for an AI-guided DevOps workflow assistant. This phase implements the foundational components that enable developers to analyze projects, initialize development workflows, and manage project configurations through intelligent slash commands integrated with Claude Code.

The foundation focuses on creating a robust, extensible architecture that supports both standalone operation and seamless Claude Code integration, with rich visual output and comprehensive project analysis capabilities.

## User Stories

### Core Slash Commands
- As a developer, I want to use `/devflow-init [project-type] [options]` to quickly scaffold a new project with best-practice configurations
- As a developer, I want to use `/devflow-analyze [--deep]` to get comprehensive insights about my project's current state and potential improvements
- As a team lead, I want to use `/devflow-roadmap [--timeline]` to generate development roadmaps based on project analysis
- As a DevOps engineer, I want to use `/devflow-optimize [--focus=area]` to identify and implement optimization opportunities

### Project Analysis Engine
- As a developer, I want automatic detection of my project type (React, Node.js, Python, etc.) so the system can provide relevant recommendations
- As a developer, I want dependency analysis that identifies outdated packages, security vulnerabilities, and optimization opportunities
- As a team lead, I want architecture assessment that evaluates code organization, design patterns, and scalability concerns
- As a developer, I want performance analysis that identifies bottlenecks and suggests improvements

### Template System
- As a developer, I want access to battle-tested templates for React applications with modern tooling (Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- As a backend developer, I want Node.js templates with Express, authentication, database integration, and API documentation
- As a Python developer, I want FastAPI/Django templates with proper project structure, testing, and deployment configs
- As a DevOps engineer, I want CI/CD templates for GitHub Actions, Docker, and deployment automation

### Project Memory
- As a developer, I want the system to remember my project preferences and previous decisions across sessions
- As a team member, I want shared project context so all team members get consistent recommendations
- As a developer, I want the ability to track project evolution and see how recommendations change over time
- As a developer, I want export capabilities to share project insights and configurations
