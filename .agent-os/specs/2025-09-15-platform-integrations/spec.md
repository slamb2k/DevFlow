# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Platform Integrations - GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Slack
> Created: 2025-09-15

## Overview

Implement comprehensive platform integrations that enable DevFlow to connect with major DevOps tools including GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Slack. This integration layer will allow DevFlow to read repository information, create issues and PRs, track project status, and send notifications, creating a unified workflow automation experience.

## User Stories

### DevOps Engineer Workflow Integration

As a DevOps engineer, I want to connect DevFlow with my existing GitHub/GitLab repositories, so that I can automate PR creation, issue tracking, and CI/CD workflows without switching between tools.

The engineer runs `/devflow-connect github` and is guided through OAuth authentication. Once connected, DevFlow can automatically create PRs with proper templates, link issues, trigger workflows, and monitor CI/CD status. The integration respects existing branch protection rules and team workflows while adding intelligent automation on top.

### Team Collaboration Through Slack

As a team lead, I want DevFlow to send notifications to Slack channels about important workflow events, so that my team stays informed about deployments, build failures, and security issues.

The team lead configures Slack integration with `/devflow-connect slack` and sets up notification rules. DevFlow then sends formatted messages to specified channels for events like successful deployments, failed builds, security vulnerabilities detected, and PR reviews needed. Messages include actionable buttons for quick responses.

### Project Management with Jira

As a project manager, I want DevFlow to sync development progress with Jira tickets, so that I can track feature completion and maintain accurate project status.

The PM connects Jira with `/devflow-connect jira` and maps DevFlow workflows to Jira statuses. When developers complete features, DevFlow automatically updates Jira tickets, adds development information, and transitions issues through the workflow based on Git activity and deployment status.

## Spec Scope

1. **GitHub Integration** - Full API integration for repository management, PR/issue creation, Actions workflow triggering, and status monitoring
2. **GitLab Integration** - Equivalent GitLab API integration supporting MRs, issues, CI/CD pipelines, and project management features
3. **Jira Integration** - Bidirectional sync for issues, automatic status updates, development information tracking, and sprint management
4. **Slack Integration** - Real-time notifications, interactive messages, slash command support, and thread-based discussions
5. **Unified Integration Manager** - Central configuration system, credential management, webhook handling, and event routing

## Out of Scope

- Custom self-hosted tool integrations beyond GitHub Enterprise and GitLab self-managed
- Direct database connections to external systems
- Real-time collaborative editing features
- Video conferencing or screen sharing capabilities
- Custom plugin development for external platforms

## Expected Deliverable

1. Working integration connections that can be tested through slash commands for GitHub, GitLab, Jira, and Slack
2. Automated workflow demonstrations showing PR creation, issue updates, and notifications working end-to-end
3. Configuration interface accessible through `/devflow-integrations` command showing connected platforms and their status
