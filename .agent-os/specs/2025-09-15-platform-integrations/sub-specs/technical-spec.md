# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-15-platform-integrations/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Integration Architecture
- **Plugin-based architecture** - Each platform integration as a separate module in `src/integrations/`
- **OAuth 2.0 implementation** - Secure authentication flow for GitHub, GitLab, and Slack
- **Personal Access Token support** - Alternative authentication for Jira and self-hosted instances
- **Webhook receiver** - Express server endpoint for receiving platform webhooks at `/webhooks/:platform`
- **Event bus system** - Internal event routing for cross-platform automation
- **Rate limiting handler** - Respect API rate limits with exponential backoff
- **Credential vault** - Encrypted storage of tokens in `.devflow/credentials/`

### Platform-Specific Requirements

#### GitHub Integration
- Use Octokit SDK for API interactions
- Support both github.com and GitHub Enterprise
- Implement GitHub App authentication for organization-wide access
- Handle GitHub Actions workflow dispatch
- Support fine-grained personal access tokens

#### GitLab Integration
- Use official GitLab SDK (@gitbeaker/node)
- Support both gitlab.com and self-managed instances
- Implement OAuth and personal token authentication
- Handle GitLab CI/CD pipeline triggers
- Support group and project level permissions

#### Jira Integration
- Use Jira REST API v3
- Implement OAuth 2.0 (3LO) for Jira Cloud
- Support both Cloud and Server/Data Center versions
- Handle custom fields and workflows
- Implement JQL query support for issue searches

#### Slack Integration
- Use Slack SDK (@slack/web-api and @slack/events-api)
- Implement OAuth 2.0 with appropriate scopes
- Support both workspace and organization apps
- Handle interactive messages and slash commands
- Implement Socket Mode for real-time events

### Data Models
- **Integration Configuration Schema** - JSON schema for each platform's settings
- **Credential Storage Format** - Encrypted JSON with platform, tokens, and metadata
- **Event Schema** - Standardized event format for cross-platform compatibility
- **Mapping Configuration** - Rules for syncing between platforms (e.g., GitHub issues to Jira)

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation when platforms are unavailable
- Retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Clear error messages indicating which integration failed
- Fallback to manual mode when automation fails
- Comprehensive logging for debugging integration issues
