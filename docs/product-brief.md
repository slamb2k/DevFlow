# DevFlow: AI-Guided DevOps Workflow Assistant

## Product Brief

### Executive Summary

**DevFlow** is an intelligent, conversational DevOps workflow assistant built on Claude Code's extensibility framework. It guides solo developers and teams through implementing best-practice development workflows using a sophisticated combination of project analysis, visual roadmaps, and automated configuration generation.

The tool provides a **guided interface experience** that walks users through setting up, updating, and optimizing their development and DevOps practices across three key scenarios:
- **New project scaffolding** from product briefs
- **Existing project enhancement** with modern DevOps capabilities  
- **Continuous optimization** for evolving requirements

### Core Value Proposition

**"From Product Brief to Production-Ready in Minutes, Not Hours"**

DevFlow transforms the complex process of implementing modern development workflows into an intuitive, guided experience that maintains consistency while adapting to specific project needs.

## Target Users & Use Cases
